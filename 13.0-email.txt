Chapter 13 - Email

Email is one of the oldest forms of digital communication, but still one of the most popular.
Python's standard library includes modules for sending, receiving, and storing email messages.

smtplib - communicates with a mail server to deliver a message.
smtpd - can be used to create a custom mail server, and provides classes useful for debugging email transmission in
    other applications.
imaplib - uses the IMAP protocol to manipulate messages stored on a server.  It provides a low-level API for IMAP
    clients and can query, retrieve, move, and delete messages.
mailbox - creates and modifies local message archives using several standard formats, including the popular mbox and
    Maildir formats used by many email client programs.
